 Linear Regression for House Price Prediction: A Data Science Project üè°

In a recent project, I developed a linear regression model to predict house prices using the popular "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset. Here's a quick rundown of the process:

Data Preparation: I selected key features like GrLivArea (above-ground living area), BedroomAbvGr (number of bedrooms), and FullBath (number of full bathrooms) to predict the SalePrice of homes. The dataset was split into training and testing sets for model validation.

Model Training: Using Python's scikit-learn library, I trained a linear regression model. The goal was to learn the relationship between the selected features and the target variable (house prices).

Performance Evaluation: I evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R¬≤) metrics. Additionally, I plotted actual vs. predicted prices to visually assess the model's accuracy.

Practical Application: To demonstrate the model's utility, I predicted the sale price of a house with specific features, showcasing how this model can be applied in real-world scenarios.

üìä Key Takeaways:

Data-driven decisions: By focusing on relevant features, we can make accurate predictions.
Model validation: Visualizations and metrics are crucial for evaluating model performance.
Real-world relevance: Predictive modeling can provide valuable insights for industries like real estate.
This project was a great exercise in applying machine learning techniques to solve practical problems. Looking forward to exploring more advanced models and expanding my data science skills! üíªüìà
